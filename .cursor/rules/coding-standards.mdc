# Spot-it iOS App - Coding Standards

## AI Behavior Rules
- **ONLY CHANGE WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED**: Never make additional changes, improvements, or modifications beyond what the user explicitly asks for
- If the user asks to fix one thing, don't "improve" other parts of the code
- If the user asks for a specific feature, don't add related features unless explicitly requested
- Always ask for clarification if the request is unclear rather than making assumptions
- Respect the existing code structure and style unless specifically asked to change it

## Swift & SwiftUI Standards
- Use SwiftUI and modern Swift 5+ features
- Follow Apple's Swift naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types)
- Prefer struct over class when possible for better performance
- Use @State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject appropriately
- Always use proper error handling with do-catch blocks
- Include print statements for debugging with clear prefixes (üéØ, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üì∏, etc.)

## Architecture Patterns
- Follow MVVM pattern with SwiftUI as seen in [ContentView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/ContentView.swift)
- Keep Views lightweight, move business logic to Services like [IdentificationManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/IdentificationManager.swift)
- Use proper dependency injection
- Implement async/await for API calls as implemented in [GoogleAPIManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/GoogleAPIManager.swift)
- Use proper memory management and avoid retain cycles

## Code Generation Preferences
- Generate complete, working code rather than snippets
- Include proper imports and dependencies
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Use modern SwiftUI patterns and modifiers
- Include proper documentation comments for complex functions
- Always use @MainActor for UI updates
- Avoid blocking the main thread

## Testing & Debugging
- Include comprehensive print statements for debugging
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex algorithms
- Handle edge cases properly
- Test on both simulator and device
