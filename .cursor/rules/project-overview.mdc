# Spot-it iOS App - Project Overview

## Project Context
This is an iOS app called "Spot-it" built with SwiftUI that uses AI to identify buildings, landmarks, and aircraft from camera photos using GPS, compass, and spatial metadata.

## Architecture Overview
The app follows MVVM pattern with SwiftUI and is organized into several key components:

### Main App Entry Point
- [ShootVeilApp.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/ShootVeilApp.swift) - App entry point
- [ContentView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/ContentView.swift) - Main view controller with camera functionality

### Views Structure
- [WelcomeView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/WelcomeView.swift) - App introduction and onboarding
- [SplashView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/SplashView.swift) - Launch screen
- [ResultsView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/ResultsView.swift) - Display identification results
- [HistoryView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/HistoryView.swift) - Historical captures and results
- [SettingsView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/SettingsView.swift) - App settings and configuration

### Core Services
- [CameraManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/CameraManager.swift) - Camera functionality and photo capture
- [LocationManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/LocationManager.swift) - GPS and location services
- [IdentificationManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/IdentificationManager.swift) - AI identification logic
- [GoogleAPIManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/GoogleAPIManager.swift) - Google APIs integration
- [FlightAwareManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/FlightAwareManager.swift) - Aircraft identification
- [ShareManager.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/ShareManager.swift) - Content sharing functionality
- [LocalDataSource.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Services/LocalDataSource.swift) - Local data persistence

### Data Models
- [CaptureMetadata.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Models/CaptureMetadata.swift) - Data structures for capture metadata

### Configuration
- [ShootVeil.entitlements](mdc:ShootVeil/ShootVeil.entitlements) - App permissions and entitlements
- [Info.plist](mdc:ShootVeil/Info.plist) - App configuration and permissions
