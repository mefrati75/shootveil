# Spot-it iOS App - UI/UX Guidelines

## Design System
- Use consistent color scheme: Blue (#0066CC), Orange (#FF6600), Purple (#6600CC)
- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- Use SF Symbols for icons throughout the app
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Use haptic feedback for user interactions
- Ensure accessibility support with proper labels and VoiceOver

## View-Specific Guidelines

### Main Camera Interface
Reference [ContentView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/ContentView.swift) for the main camera implementation:
- Keep camera controls intuitive and easily accessible
- Provide clear visual feedback for capture states
- Display GPS accuracy indicators
- Show appropriate mode indicators (landmark, aircraft, boat)

### Results Display
Reference [ResultsView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/ResultsView.swift) for results presentation:
- Present identification results with clear visual hierarchy
- Include confidence scores and metadata
- Provide share functionality with proper formatting
- Show location information when available

### History Management
Reference [HistoryView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/HistoryView.swift) for historical data:
- Implement lazy loading for performance
- Use proper list organization and filtering
- Provide search and sort functionality
- Enable swipe actions for item management

### Settings & Configuration
Reference [SettingsView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/SettingsView.swift) for app configuration:
- Group related settings logically
- Provide clear descriptions for each setting
- Include proper validation for user inputs
- Show current permission states

## User Experience Patterns
- Always request permissions with proper context and explanation
- Provide clear onboarding experience through [WelcomeView.swift](mdc:ShootVeil/Views/WelcomeView.swift)
- Implement smooth transitions between different app states
- Handle edge cases gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns throughout the app

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize image processing and memory usage
- Use lazy loading for lists and grids
- Implement proper background processing for heavy tasks
- Avoid blocking the main thread with camera operations
- Cache responses when appropriate to improve user experience
